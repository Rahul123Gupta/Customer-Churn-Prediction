📉 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a business using historical customer data. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling businesses to take proactive retention strategies.

📖 About the Project

I built this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning learning journey to understand how predictive modeling can help businesses reduce churn and improve customer retention. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model building.

📊 Key Highlights

Performed Data Cleaning and Preprocessing using Pandas & NumPy

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and churn patterns

Built predictive models using Machine Learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Visualized key features and churn trends using Matplotlib & Seaborn

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains customer information such as demographics, account details, usage patterns, and subscription status. It was used to identify factors influencing churn and train predictive models.

💡 Insights Found

Customers with lower engagement or higher service issues are more likely to churn

Tenure and subscription type are significant predictors of churn

Predictive modeling can help businesses target at-risk customers with retention strategies

🚀 Future Enhancements

Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for real-time churn prediction

Use ensemble methods or deep learning for improved accuracy

Incorporate customer feedback and sentiment analysis to enhance predictions
